                    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use the ANSCIMS website and mobile applications</p>
                    <p>Throughout this Privacy Policy we will refer to our website and mobile applications collectively as “Services”.</p>
                    <p>Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.</p>
                    <p>Your continued use of the Services will signify acceptance of the terms of the Policy and its updates.</p>
                    <p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any of our products or services that have a separate privacy policy. 
                        If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>Your privacy is critically important to us. We have a few fundamental principles: We are thoughtful about the personal 
                        information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our services</p>
                    <p>We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it. We aim to make it as simple as possible for 
                            you to control what information on our website is shared publicly (or kept private), indexed by search engines, and permanently deleted. </p>

                <div>
                    <h3>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
                    <p>We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so–for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to 
                        make our Services better. We collect information in three ways: if and when you provide information to us, 
                        automatically through operating our services, and from outside sources. Let’s go over the information that we collect</p>
                    <em>Information You Provide to Us</em>
                    <p>It is probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us. 
                        The amount and type of information depends on the context and how we use the information. Here are some examples:</p>
                    <em>Basic Account Information:</em>
                    <p>We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account. For example, we require individuals who sign up 
                        for a user accounts to provide a userID – your Name, phone number, email address–and that’s it. 
                        You may provide us with more information–like your position at work–but we don’t require that information to create your account</p>
                    <em>Credentials:</em>
                    <p>Depending on the Services you use, you may provide us with credentials for your User account (like username and password). </p>
                    <em>Communications with Us:</em>
                    <p>You may also provide us information when you respond to surveys, communicate with our Customer Service operators about a support question.</p>

                    <h4>We also collect some information automatically</h4><br>
                    <em>Log Information:</em>
                    <p>Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, 
                        IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. 
                        We collect log information when you use our Services–for example, when you create or make changes to your profile</p>
                    <em>Usage Information:</em>
                    <p>We collect information about your usage of our Services. For example, we collect information about the actions that site administrators and users 
                        perform on a site–in other words, who did what, when and to what thing on a site. We also collect information about what happens when you use our 
                        Services (e.g., page views, support document, button clicks) along with information about your device (e.g., name of cellular network, and mobile 
                        device manufacturer). We use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, as well as get insights on how people use our Services, 
                        so we can make our Services better.</p>
                    <em>Location Information:</em>
                    <p>We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this 
                        information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain towns/cities in the state. </p>
                    <em>Information from Cookies & Other Technologies:</em>
                    <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website 
                        each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and e-mails. 
                        We use cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track users and usage.</p>
                    
                    <em>How We Use Information</em>
                    <p>We use information about you as mentioned above and as follows: </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>To provide our Services–for example, to set up and maintain your account.</li>
                      <li>To further develop our Services</li>
                      <li>To monitor and analyze how users interact with our Services, which helps us improve our Services and make them easier to use;</li>
                      <li>To monitor and protect the security of our Services, detect and prevent fraudulent transactions 
                        and other illegal activities, and protect our rights and property as well as the rights and property of others;</li>
                      <li>To personalize your experience using our Services.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p></p>
                </div>

                  <h3>SHARING INFORMATION</h3><br>
                  <em>How We Share Information </em>
                  <p>We do not sell our users’ private personal information. 
                    We share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Subsidiaries, Employees, and Independent Contractors: We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries, our employees, 
                      and individuals who are our independent contractors that need to know the information in order to help us provide our Services or 
                      to process the information on our behalf. We require our subsidiaries, employees, and independent contractors to 
                      follow this Privacy Policy for personal information that we share with them.</li>
                    <li>Third Party Vendors: We may share information about you with third party vendors who need to know information about you in order 
                      to provide their services to us. This group includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you and those that help us 
                      understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers). We require vendors to agree to privacy commitments in order 
                      to share information with them.</li>
                    <li>As Required by Law: We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.</li>
                    <li>With Your Consent: We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction. 
                      For example, we may share your information with third parties with which you authorize us to do so. </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p></p>
                  <em>Security</em>
                  <p>While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, 
                    alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so. To enhance the security of your account, 
                    we encourage you to enable our advanced security settings.</p>
                  <em>Privacy Policy Changes</em>
                  <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, we may change our Privacy Policy from time to time. We encourage visitors to frequently 
                    check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the change log below, 
                    and, in some cases, we may provide additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you a notification 
                    through e-mail or your dashboard)<br>If you have a user account, you should also check your dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of the Services after 
                    any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your consent to such change.</p>
